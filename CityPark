## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

I call my idea CityPark. Tell me how many times have you gone to any city (especially its downtown area) and found yourself circling countless city blocks before you can finally parallel park your big SUV into that spot that’s probably only meant for sedans? If I were a betting man, I’d guess your response would be “numerous” or “a lot”. Well, the idea for my project is an application to help combat all of this wasted time if you know your destination. Maybe think of it as Waze, but for parking. 

I see 3 main features of this application. I’d like it to be able to take an input location and based on how easily other users can park, output all available parking options if there are any. These parking options include parallel parking required, metered parking, garage, completely free parking, etc. Next, I’d like to store parking availabilities for certain areas and make predictions on availability in the case that no users are currently reporting data for that area. Finally, in the scenario that there is paid parking, I’d like to have a feature that interfaces between the customer who wants to park and the company/person who offers parking. This type of information would help the predictive feature but also would help customers so that they don’t have to be running back to their cars to put a ticket stub to say they paid for parking for the next 2 hours.
